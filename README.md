# ðŸ“‹ **Red-Black Tree Visualizer Project**  

An interactive C++ project that allows users to perform various operations on a **Red-Black Tree**, including adding nodes, deleting nodes, finding successors/predecessors, and more. The project includes **graphical visualizations** using the **SFML library** to help users better understand tree structures and key operations.

## ðŸ”§ **Key Features**  
- Add/Delete nodes in a Red-Black Tree  
- Visualize minimum/maximum nodes, successors, and predecessors  
- Display tree structure, inorder traversal, and tree depth  
- Highlight nodes in **yellow** during key operations  
- Calculate black-height, maximum black/red keys, and tree depth  

## ðŸ–¥ **Technologies Used**  
- **C++** for core logic  
- **SFML** for graphical visualizations  

## ðŸš€ **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.  
3. Ensure **SFML** is installed and linked correctly.  
4. Run the executable and follow the interactive menu.  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: The project is ideal for students and developers looking to understand the mechanics of Red-Black Trees with visual support.
